# Plotting
Hi guys. I developed this Java code, for demonstration purposes. This Code, creates a Java GUI (with swing and awt library) showing the graph of the function f (x) = 3 + [x-1] * exp(-x / 3). In addition to the graph of the function, the GUI also shows the Cartesian axes. This software also to change the extremes of the graph and enlarge or reduce the graph. I hope it's simple. Good luck!
