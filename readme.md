# Plotting
Hi guys. I developed this Java code, for demonstration purposes. This Code, creates a Java GUI (with swing and awt library) showing the graph of the function
```math
f(x) = 3 - \frac{1 - x}{e^ {\frac{x}{3}}}
```
In addition to the graph of the function, the GUI also shows the Cartesian axes. This software also to change the extremes of the graph and enlarge or reduce the graph. I hope it's simple. Good luck!
